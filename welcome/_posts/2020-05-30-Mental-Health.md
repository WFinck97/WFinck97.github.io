# Mental Health - we're in this together
> “If we start being honest about our pain, our anger, and our shortcomings instead of pretending they don’t exist, then maybe we’ll leave the world a better place than we found it.” – Russell Wilson

During my time at UNB, I spent two years as a proctor (AKA "resident assistant"). Basically, I lived in a residence building with about 70 other students and my role was to help maintain a healthy community. A large part of my responsibilities consisted of checking in with residents and refering them to appropriate resources if ever there was a problem. For example, I would refer students to academic resources for help with their school work. But most often, it would refer students to counselling services (a school facility where you could schedule appointments with counsellors) for help with their mental health. 

This is when I realised that we *all* deal with mental health challenges. No one is exempt. Let me repeat that: ***everyone*** (including you and me) *has* struggled, is *currently* struggling, or *will* struggle with their own mental health - it's part of being human. I met countless people from various backgrounds, some more open to mental health than others. But, the one commonality was that counselling services *consistently* helped people manage their mental health. Not once did someone leave counselling services worse than when they entered.

It's important to do some things by yourself, but dealing with mental health is not one of them. I admit, it can be hard to talk about mental health with friends and family. Luckily, there is almost always an external resource for you to seek help, including your school counsellor (and your future resident assistant - for those planning on attending university).

We are incredibly lucky to be living in a time when mental health awareness is a widespread and socially acceptable topic. Not only that, our collective understanding of mental health is expanding. For instance, the growing fields of psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science. Psychologist, neuroscientists, and other related professionals, **dedicate their lives** to understanding the human mind, including all the reasons why people struggle with their mental health. What this means for us is that we have access to some of the *most effective* methods, treatments, and resources for managing our mental health - as long as we are willing to seek external help.

Self-care, meaning managing your own mental health, is an integral aspect of living a happy, healthy life.
