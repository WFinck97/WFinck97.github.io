# Conclusion - thank you

If you have made it this far, congratulations and thank you. I know that some of these ideas (and quotes) are a bit, well, bleak. But, I would be lying if I didn't say there are many challenges ahead for our generation. There is still plenty of room for optimism, but not without action. The world needs young leaders like yourself to step up and fight for what matters to you. Collectively, we can change the world for the better.

Welcome to the "becoming an adult" part of your life.

Sincerely,

Wesley
