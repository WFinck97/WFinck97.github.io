# Attention - sacrifice and the most valuable resource
> “In a world deluged by irrelevant information, clarity is power.”― Yuval Noah Harari

Do you find you have a short attention span? I know I do. The most likely reason for this is because of the *attention economy*. *Attention economy* may seem like a fancy term, but all it means is that **some companies profit off of capturing their user's attention**. Let me explain.

Most likely, you use platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. For us, these services are free. But, these companies still need to make money (it is business after all). How does a company make money when it's users don't pay anything? Well, they make a large portion of their revenue by showing us ads. The more ads they are able to show, the more money they get from the advertisers. It's quite a simple set of equations actually:

more time = more ads
more ads = more money

And so, if these companies want to make more money (which, FYI, they 100% do), they need us to **spend more time on their platform**. Unfortunately, this motivates them to make their platforms as *addictive* and *engaging* as possible - so we can spend more time consuming ads. 

In fact, many of these platforms use a human behavior design technique called *intermittend variable rewards*, which is a technique **used in slot machines** and has been studied extensively in [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Intermittent_reinforcement.3B_schedules). There is a *very precisely calculated* reason why we find ourselves scrolling through social media feeds so often. Let me rephrase that: SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED TO BE AS **ADDICTIVE AS POSSIBLE** BECAUSE IT MAXIMIZES THEIR PROFIT.

If you are interested in learning more about the design techniques used by social media platforms, [this article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds_b_10155754) is a great resources. A short excerpt:
> "If you want to maximize addictiveness, all tech designers need to do is link a user’s action (like pulling a lever) with a variable reward. You pull a lever and immediately receive either an enticing reward (a match, a prize!) or nothing. Addictiveness is maximized when the rate of reward is most variable.'' - Tristan Harris

Okay, so what does this have to do with sacrifice? And why is attention the most valuable resource? Well, simply put, our attention is our time (which is finite, AKA you are going to die one day), and I would imagine you want to spend your time well (I sure do). If you want to have better control over your own attention, which you can, you will have to make sacrifices. As an example, you will have to make sacrifices when it comes to selecting the content you consume. I think of this as a sacrifice because we can become very attached to our social networks and the content we are used to consuming. Choosing what to cut out can be tough. But, **there is simply too much content to not be selective about what you spend your time consuming.** 

Chances are, like me, your attention has already been "hacked" by these dishonest design tricks. Developing more focused attention will take a lot of patience and sacrifice, but, it is possible and I do hope you take this seriously. By sacrificing a bit of immediate satisfaction (say, scrolling through a social media feed or watching that recommended YouTube video) you can slowly gain the longer term benefits of having more focused attention. 

Having an awareness of the flaws in modern technology can help us make more informed and genuine decisions. The reality, sadly, is that these companies do not have our well-being in their best interest.
