## Introduction
Hey there and welcome. If you are coming from the [videos](link to youtube vids), welcome back. For those that are new, let me quickly introduce myself. I'm Wesley, and I graduated from Pemberton Secondary School (PSS) in June 2015. I also just finished an elecrical engineering degree at the University of New Brunswick, so I think that means I'm officially an "adult" now. 

Normally, I try my best to visit at least once a year and give some sort of a presentation to the more senior students. Every time, I ask myself *what is the most valuable insight I can share during this presentation?* Like many of you, I was nearing the end of high school with very little idea about what I wanted to do with my life. How could anyone expect me to make *life decisions* when I lacked so much *life experience*? It just didn't make any sense. And so, I want to share advice that may provide useful in your own decision making as you near the end of high school.

One of my main motivation for doing this is to share advice that I wish I had received when I was in your position. In the past, I have focused on advice more specifically related to university. But, I honestly think there's enough resources freely available on those topics. Instead, I want to explore a few topics that are more general and perhaps even less commonly discussed. Of course, this list is by no means conclusive and extensive. Think of them more so as ideas I would encourage you to further contemplate and explore. Lastly, these are my opinions, so I would hope you disagree with some of them.

With that, I truly hope you find the advice helpful, and I wish you the best of luck as you get closer to graduating high school.
