# Role Models - actions speak for themselves
> “Being a role model is equal parts being who you actually are and what people hope you will be.” Meryl Streep

As I have mentioned before, because of the internet and social media platforms, we are constantly exposed to some of the worlds most talented, successful, and lucky individuals. Not only that, even our friends and family typically highlight their best moments in life on social media. Because of this, in can be easy to feel jealous, endlessly seeing other people living a more exciting and/or desireable lifestyle.

This is why I think it is important to identify key role models in life. A role model will not try to make you jealous of their fortune or accomplishments or hard work, rather, they will empower you (even if you don't know them directly) to be a better version of yourself. A role model should be someone who you can admire *without* feeling (too) jealous. Jealousy is natural, but it's important to recognize when we are experiencing it. 

Follow people that empower you and make you feel good about yourself, not jealous. Similarly to what I said about our own attention, **there are simply too many people looking for followers to not be selective about who you follow**. In case you were wondering, some of my personal role models are (all of which have influenced these very points I am sharing with you in some way or another):
- [Yuval Noah Harari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari)
- [Tristan Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_Harris)
- J.K. Rowling (especially Albus Dumbledore)

If ever I am in a difficult situation, I like to ask myself *what would my role models do in this situation?*

With that said, it's also important to try and be a role model yourself. Humans are social animals, so, naturally, we want to be accepted by our peers. In the short term, this may lead us to value popularity and social status above connection, empowerment, and authenticity. But, trying to be a role model forces you to question your own actions and introspect in healthy ways. It can help you determine which choices have better long term benefits and which choices may only lead to temporary rewards. Being a role model can also give you a sense of purpose and responsibility, both of which can really help you find more direction in life. 

Rather than seeking large numbers of followers, aim to positively influece a small number of people around you. Your impact on these other people will bring you so much more fullfillment than any number of followers could.
